# Push to GCR GitHub Action

An action that build docker image and push to Google Cloud Registry.

This action can be used to perform on every git `push` or every `tag` creation.

## Inputs

### `gcloud_service_key`
The service account key of google cloud. The json file can be encoded in base64 or in plain text. This field is required.

### `registry`
The registry where the image should be pushed. Default `gcr.io`.

### `project_id`
The project id. This field is required.

### `image_name`
The image name. This field is required.

### `image_tag`
The tag for the image. To create multiple tag of the same image, provide comma (`,`) separeted tag name (e.g. `v2.1,v2,latest`).

Default: `latest`.

To use the pushed `Tag Name` as image tag, see the [example](https://github.com/RafikFarhad/push-to-gcr-github-action/blob/master/example/build_only_tags.yml).

### `dockerfile`
The image building Dockerfile. 
If context is changed, `Dockerfile` from context folder will be used.

Default: `./Dockerfile`.

### `context`
The docker build context. Default: `.`

### `target`
If you use multi-stage build and want to stop builing at a certain image, you can use this field. Default value is empty.

### `build_args`
Pass a list of env vars as build-args for docker-build, separated by commas. ie: `HOST=db.default.svc.cluster.local:5432,USERNAME=db_user`

### `push_only`
If you want to skip the build step and just push the image built by any previous step, use this option. Default for this is `false`.

## Permissions
The service key you provided must have the `Storage Admin` permission to push the image to GCR.
It is possible to use a lower access level `Storage Object Admin`, but it will work only for already created registry. You must also add the `Storage Legacy Bucket Reader` permission to the `artifacts.<project id>.appspot.com` bucket for the given service account.

NB: The included workflow which tests the action's basic functionalities needs a Github secrets named `JSON_GCLOUD_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`.
Currently, the workflow is not testable for forked repositories but I have an action item to enable this.
